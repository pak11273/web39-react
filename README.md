WEB39 Starting a react App

1. Fork and clone repo
2. npx create-react-app . (doing it this way will create the react app inside the current folder)

Add the end of each mornings support hours I will push the changes up into that days branch.  The final version will be push to main.  
Each morning before just pull from yesterdays branch to keep up to date.
